MiniWorld allows environments to be easily edited like Minigrid meets DM Lab. It can simulate environments with rooms, doors, hallways, and various objects (e.g., office and home environments, mazes).

## Installation

```python
pip install miniworld
```

## Usage

The Gymnasium interface allows to initialize and interact with the Miniworld default environments as follows:

```python
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("MiniWorld-OneRoom-v0", render_mode="human")

observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)
for _ in range(1000):
   action = policy(observation)  # User-defined policy function
   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

   if terminated or truncated:
      observation, info = env.reset()
env.close()
```
